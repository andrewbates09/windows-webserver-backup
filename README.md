windows-webserver-backup
========================

Simple backup script for a M$ Windows server &amp; MySQL

Feel free to change whatever, this is a basic backup setup.  It is designed to throw backups in a place that get's grabbed via tapes.

Let me know if you have any questions/suggestions concerning the script.

BTW: the script can be obfuscated, tossed into X:\scripts\, and scheduled as a task

PS: untested backups are just a waste of space
